* Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

## Background

* Providing a more efficient way to **lay out**, **align** and **distribute** space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.

* give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes).
