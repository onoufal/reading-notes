# jQuery

* jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common
JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major
browsers and without any fallback code needed.

* jQuery is a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages. It lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something with the elements using jQuery methods. 

1. FIND ELEMENTS USING CSS-STYLE SELECTORS 

* A function called jQuery () lets you find one or more elements in the page. lt creates an object called jQuery which holds references to those elements. $() is often used as a shorthand to save typing jQuery(), as shown here. 

2. DO SOMETHING WITH THE ELEMENTS USING JQUERY METHODS 

* jQuery object is created by the jQuery() function. The object and the elements it contains is referred to as a matched set or a jQuery selection. 

* You can then use the methods of the jQuery object 
to update the elements that it contains. Here, the 
method adds a new value to the class attribute. 

* jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write with plain JavaScript.
