## Node.js
* Node is built on Chrome’s V8 which is a performance designed open source JavaScript engine that run in chromium based web browsers.

* Node.js is a Java Script runtime we use to execute JavaScript on our computer without a web browser.

* Before we used node built-in console module to log our code, we can log them in the console by run the command ``` node filename.js``` using node.js.

* We dont have to worry about compatibility issues — as we would if we were writing in different browsers because node.js support ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and after versions.

* NPM is a JavaScript Package Manager and it is the world’s largest software registry

* Installing a package globally:
```npm install -g PackageName```

* Installing a package locally:

* Create and auto-populate a package.json file:
```npm init -y```

* Install the lodash package and save it:
```npm install lodash --save```


* ```node_modules``` can be created by runninng ```npm install```

* Common node.js uses is installing (via npm) and running (via Node) and  running JavaScript on the server.

* Building tools Designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

* One advantage to use node.js running on the server tis asynchronous, the non-blocking behavior and registering callback and continue working on the next event.

* This model excution causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.
