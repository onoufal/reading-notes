# Domain Modeling:
>is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.

* object-oriented model: 
>stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods

* Writing out and testing your code will help you remember how to implement domain models

* Storing data within properties ensures any newly created object can access that data later.

* A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

* Tips to follow when building your own domain models.

1. Build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

2. Use a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

# Tables:
* Tables is written out row by row.

* Table Tags:
`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`.
* The `<th colspan = "2">` attribute can be used on a `<th>` or `<td>` element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.
* The `rowspan` attribute can be
used on a `<th>` or `<td>` element
to indicate how many rows a cell
should span down the table.


* The headings of the table should
sit inside the `<thead>` element.


* The body should sit inside the
`<tbody>` element.

* The footer belongs inside the
`<tfoot>` element.
