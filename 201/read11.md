# Practical Information:

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
* the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link to your site in
their results.
* SEO is split into two areas: **on-page techniques** and **off-page techniques.**

### on-page techniques:

2. URL / Web Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt Text
7. Page Descriptions

#### Identify keywords and phrases:
1. List down the words that someone might type into
Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics, products or services your site is
about.
2. Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your
website.
3. enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider, such as: adwords.google.co.uk/ select KeywordToolExternal (When using this tool, select the "exact match" option rather than
"broad match.") www.wordtracker.com www keyworddiscovery.com
4. Some of the keyword research
sites can tell you how many
people have searched for a
specific keyword to help you
know how much competition
those terms have.
5. Now you need to pick which
keywords you will focus on.
These should always be the ones
that are most relevant to each
section of your site.
6. Now that you have a refined list
of keywords, you know which
have the most competition, and
which ones are most relevant,
it is time to start picking which
keywords you will use for each
page.
